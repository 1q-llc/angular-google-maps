<span class="badge badge-info">New in v2.0.0</span>
MarkerLabel's are now supported as options. Please see <a href="http://google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/tags/markerwithlabel/1.1.9/docs/reference.html">MarkerLabelOptions<a>.
<p>
If <strong>any</strong> option of "label{SomeOption}" is defined then MarkerChildModel (within the underlying {{thing}} directive) will consider the marker being created to be a MarkerLabel.</a>
