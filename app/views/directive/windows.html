<h4>Description</h4>

<p>The <code>windows</code> directive is used to display multiple <acronym>InfoWindow</acronym> objects on your map. It has
a performance advantage over the <code><a href="#!/api#window">window</a></code> directive since you don't have to rely on
<code>ng-repeat</code> to instantiate the multiple objects.</p>
