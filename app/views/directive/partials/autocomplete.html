<span class="badge badge-info">New in v2.0.12</span>
SearchBox can now be instantiated as an Autocomplete object. Please see <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places-autocomplete">the differences between Autocomplete and SearchBox</a>.

If options.autocomplete equals true (Boolean), the options object will then accept <a href="google.maps.places.AutocompleteOptions">AutocompleteOptions</a>.
