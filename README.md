===================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nlaplante/angular-google-maps.png?branch=gh-pages-new2)](https://travis-ci.org/nlaplante/angular-google-maps)

This is the angular google maps website branch. This is where you'll find sources for the official 
website including the API documentation and the live example.

Feel free to open pull requests to improve the docs.

The website is built using [yo](http://yeoman.io/) and [generator-angular](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular). To run the site locally, you'll need [bower](http://bower.io/) and [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) in your path;

```
$ git clone https://github.com/nlaplante/angular-google-maps
$ cd angular-google-maps
$ git checkout gh-pages-new2
$ npm install 
$ bower install
$ grunt server
```
